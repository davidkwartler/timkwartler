  summary: [
    "Computer science B.S. / M.S. student at WPI with skills in full-stack software development, leadership experience in large student organizations, and a passion for building impactful, collaborative software solutions.",
  ],

  careerBackground: `I'm a Computer Science student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute pursuing both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees. My focus is on full-stack software development, and I have a passion for building impactful, collaborative software solutions.

I've gained hands-on experience through my internship at 7Factor, where I developed a webhooks-as-a-service platform and built data transformations to support multiple request/response formats.

Outside of traditional software engineering, I manage end-to-end livestream production for high-profile esports events, leading a team of five to deliver events like Red Bull Campus Clutch Northeast Regionals and the 2025 World Cube Association USA Nationals.

I enjoy working on personal projects that solve real problems, from Minecraft server management tools to Rubik's Cube solve tracking apps. I'm always looking for opportunities to learn new technologies and contribute to meaningful projects.`,
